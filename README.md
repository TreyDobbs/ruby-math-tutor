# ruby-math-tutor

• This is a Ruby script that will allow a youngster to practice his arithmetic skills. 
  More specifically, the program will allow the user to choose between addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division problems. 

• The program encompasses six functions:

	- One to display the menu
  
	- One to handle addition (In Easy level, generates two random numbers between 0-10, asks the user for the sum, 
	  reads their answer from the keyboard, compares to see if it was correct, displays if they got it right or wrong, 
	  and displays the correct answer if they got it wrong)
    
	- One to handle subtraction (similar to addition, difference will be between 0-10 in Easy level)
  
	- One to handle multiplication (similar to addition, factors are 0-10 in Easy level)
  
	- One to handle division (similar to addition, quotient will be between 0-10 in Easy level)
  
	- One to get the level of difficulty for problems. This function asks user to enter “E” for easy, “M” for medium,
	  or “D” for difficult. The function loops until a valid choice is entered. Once valid, that letter will be returned.
    
	- When the user chooses Quit from the menu, the script displays the number correct, the number attempted, and the
	  percentage correct.
